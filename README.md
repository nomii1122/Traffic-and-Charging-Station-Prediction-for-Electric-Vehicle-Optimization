EV Charging Demand Forecasting
This project aims to forecast electric vehicle (EV) charging demand using machine learning and deep learning models. The three models consisted of ARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM, all of which, however, were directed towards achieving one common goal: to promote charging station efficiency and reduce congestion in EV infrastructure.

 Results Summary
ÔÇ∑XGBoost outperformed both ARIMA and LSTM in all accuracy metrics.
ÔÇ∑ARIMA was only good for simple trends.
ÔÇ∑LSTM showed potential but needs better tuning and more data.
Key Takeaways
ÔÇ∑Predicting EV charging demand helps improve smart grid planning and reduce overload at charging stations.
ÔÇ∑Using machine learning, cities can end up preparing future progressive ways for themselves, for electric mobility.
